# MixedSystemsAttractivePassivesCode

 Simulates a mixture of active and passive particles. 
 
 The active particles are circular, with an internal variable that tracks their orientation to implement an active motion. They experience a small rotational diffusion.
 
 The passive particles are circular. They undergo a thermal diffusion. These will be attractive to the active particles (the result of which is a net torque acting on the swimmers). 
 
 Both species will experience a WCA potential. This will be: active-active, active-passive, passive-active.
 
 Initially, there will be no passive-passive interaction.
